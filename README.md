# Telling Stories with Data Portfolio
Mizuki Kadowaki's portfolio for Storytelling with Data!

# About Me
I was born in Tokyo, Japan and grew up in Cupertino, California since I was 2 years old. 🎌🇺🇸 Fueled by my innate curiosity and a passion for coding, I am dedicated to unraveling truths through data and innovating data-driven products. 💪

Outside of work, I am an avid coffee enthusiast who relishes the adventure of exploring new cities. My hobbies are DIY crafting anything from making artisan keycaps to sewing clothing. I am also a movie enthusiast and my favorites are Ghibli, Marvel and Star Wars 😍

Fun facts about me are that I get startled easily and can’t handle horror movies. 😱

# What I hope to Learn 
- How to make more concise data visualizations
- Farmiliarize myself with data visualization tools
