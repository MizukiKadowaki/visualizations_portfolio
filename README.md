# Telling Stories with Data Portfolio
Mizuki Kadowaki's portfolio for Storytelling with Data!

# About Me
I was born in Tokyo, Japan and grew up in Cupertino, California since I was 2 years old. 🎌🇺🇸 Fueled by my innate curiosity and a passion for coding, I am dedicated to unraveling truths through data and innovating data-driven products. 💪

Outside of work, I am an avid coffee enthusiast who relishes the adventure of exploring new cities. My hobbies are DIY crafting anything from making artisan keycaps to sewing clothing. I am also a movie enthusiast and my favorites are Ghibli, Marvel and Star Wars 😍

Fun facts about me are that I get startled easily and can’t handle horror movies. 😱

# What I hope to Learn 
- How to make more concise data visualizations
- Farmiliarize myself with data visualization tools
- Learn to critique my own work so I can improve
- I have a technical Data Science background and hope to work as a Data Scientist or Engineer in the future
- Combine my technical data background with design to be a more effectively communicate my work

#### Part 3
I used a line chart in order to visualize changes in debt from each country over the years. I wanted to represent countries that saw a significant change in debt to GDP ratio, which is why I included countries that consistently stayed above or below 100. In order to establish 100 as a threshold, I made a bolded reference line. I found a significant pattern where the debt to GDP ratio in many countries started to rise dramatically in 2007 and start to taper or slowly decrease around 2014. Ireland had a unique pattern because although their debt increased dramatically, they also had the largest recovery out of all of the countries. I used a thicker line to highlight Ireland and used a different color to highlight it. I used green because It is a representative color of Ireland.
