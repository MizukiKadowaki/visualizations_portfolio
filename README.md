# Telling Stories with Data Portfolio
Mizuki Kadowaki's portfolio for Storytelling with Data!

# About Me
I was born in Tokyo, Japan and grew up in Cupertino, California since I was 2 years old. üéåüá∫üá∏ Fueled by my innate curiosity and a passion for coding, I am dedicated to unraveling truths through data and innovating data-driven products. üí™

Outside of work, I am an avid coffee enthusiast who relishes the adventure of exploring new cities. My hobbies are DIY crafting anything from making artisan keycaps to sewing clothing. I am also a movie enthusiast and my favorites are Ghibli, Marvel and Star Wars üòç

Fun facts about me are that I get startled easily and can‚Äôt handle horror movies. üò±

# What I hope to Learn 
- How to make more concise data visualizations
- Farmiliarize myself with data visualization tools
- Learn to critique my own work so I can improve
- I have a technical Data Science background and hope to work as a Data Scientist or Engineer in the future
- Combine my technical data background with design to be a more effectively communicate my work

## Assignment: [Visualizing government debt using Tableau](visualizing-government-debt)
#### Part 1

#### Part 3
I used a line chart in order to visualize changes in debt from each country over the years. I wanted to represent countries that saw a significant change in debt to GDP ratio, which is why I included countries that consistently stayed above or below 100. In order to establish 100 as a threshold, I made a bolded reference line. I found a significant pattern where the debt to GDP ratio in many countries started to rise dramatically in 2007 and start to taper or slowly decrease around 2014. Ireland had a unique pattern because although their debt increased dramatically, they also had the largest recovery out of all of the countries. I used a thicker line to highlight Ireland and used a different color to highlight it. I used green because It is a representative color of Ireland.

## Assignment: Critique by reDesign with Tableau
#### 1. Visualization Choice 
![Assignment3:4 original](https://github.com/MizukiKadowaki/visualizations_portfolio/assets/29721038/235025a1-1fc1-4bc6-bfd7-8a15e9ad9884)

#### 2. My Critique

Usefulness - 8/10

This visualization is incredibly useful for those who are health conscious but also price conscious. As this is from a body building blog, the audience of this visualization is for people who want to understand their protein sources and its effectiveness. It is a very casual, approachable visualization which matches the audience and publication method. Because this visualization is published online and made to be viewed by people who live in different cities, the dollar amount will not be the same everywhere. The exact dollar amount is not important, rather the comparison between the different protein sources. This graph could be used to substitute one‚Äôs diet for more price conscious or protein rich foods. However, one thing to keep in mind is that while things like chicken and beef may serve as replacements for each other, milk will not be able to replace beef because it is a completely different food group. 

Completeness - 9/10

The visualization contains all necessary information to understand. It does not provide labels for the specific dollar amount of each protein source and the currency is unclear because there are many types of dollars used around the world. However, I do not think that this is necessary because the visualization does not show specific dollar amounts. 

Perceptibility - 3/10

The choice of using a bar graph is appropriate for this visualization. However there are illogical comparisons of calorie count within the bars. Intuitively, the values within the bars would be the y-axis cost amount. However, they use calorie amount. It is unclear whether this calorie count is of the amount it takes to get 30g of protein. 

Truthfulness - 2/10

It is very difficult to gauge the exact pricing of these different foods because prices will vary depending on location, store and even brand. These are all single examples which makes it misleading to title this visualization ‚ÄúHow much does 30g of Protein cost?‚Äù because it makes it seem as though this visualization provides answers on price rather than which products are generally less expensive than others. It may also be deceptive to compare all of these protein sources because they are not the same. Although it is helpful to have the calorie information included in the visualization, the placement is misleading and there is no indication anywhere else in the visualization that calorie information is important.  

Intuitiveness - 2/10

This visualization is not intuitive because wording such as ‚Äúcost effectiveness‚Äù makes it seem like cheaper is better. However, by sorting the protein sources in descending order from left to right, our attention is drawn towards the longer, more expensive bars. It is also unintuitive because the bars contain calorie information, and not the specific price, which is what you would expect. Because calorie information is not correlated with price or protein, this makes the bars seem disproportionate even though they are not. 

Aesthetics - 5/10

The aesthetics are not bad and do not prevent the information from getting across. The small graphic visualizations of each food are not helpful because they are too small to identify and sometimes misleading. For example, when seeing the carton, I automatically assumed that this was milk, when it was a carton of egg whites. Similarly, it is very difficult to differentiate the yogurt and the cottage cheese. There seems to be some redundancy between the title, subtitle, and y axis label that should be eliminated. 

Engagement - 7/10

The bar graph is an effective visualization for comparing the prices of different types of protein. The information portrayed is very interesting and can be useful for anyone trying to find ways to have a healthier diet. However, it is slightly distracting and difficult to read.

#### 4. Usability Testing

Grad Student, 20s 
- Title is misleading because the types 
- The categories are good. 

Student, 20s
- It makes sense. 
- Title takes a bit to understand because when I think protein then I think how much? 
- I don‚Äôt care about differences in a few cents. 
- I don‚Äôt like reading numbers. It looks cluttered.
- It makes me question whether these numbers are accurate because prices vary. 

Student, 20s
- ‚Äúyour protein‚Äù part of the title is misleading because there are different types of protein. 
- Eggs should be in the meat category because it is a different type of protein than dairy. 
- 30g would be a better measure than 20g because that is what most people in fitness aim for. 


What I learned:
- There are different perspectives on what foods fit into which food categories. I originally included Eggs in the same category as Dairy. I found that health conscious people who are very aware of protein intake and protein type categorize eggs with meat and fish. From a cooking perspective, eggs are grouped more closely with dairy. 
- With the nature of bar graphs, it is always the assumption that the longer bars are ‚Äúbetter‚Äù even if they are ordered in ascending order. I am not sure how to change that bias. 
- Price values down to the cent are not important in this case. They just add clutter. Numbers should be adjusted to represent 30g. 
- Title is very important and needs to be well thought out..
