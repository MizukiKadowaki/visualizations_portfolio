# Final Project - Part 1
## Executive Summary
The primary objective of this project is to empower individuals, in making informed decisions about selecting a US city to live in without the necessity of owning a car. 

In an era where environmental sustainability and cost-effective living take center stage, the analysis of optimal cities for car-free living has become increasingly relevant. I will delve into the intricacies of selecting the best cities in the world to live in without the need for a personal vehicle, considering factors such as walkability, public transportation infrastructure, cost implications, and overall urban livability.

Transportation plays a pivotal role in everyday energy consumption, I seek to address the dual concerns of environmental impact and economic feasibility. It caters to readers who prioritize eco-friendly and cost-efficient modes of living.

## The Storyline
1. The Problem: Relying on Personal Vehicles for Everyday transportation needs
2. The Solution is to not have a car! 
3. What does a city’s infrastructure have to provide to make this reasonable for most people?
4. Walkability! Transportation infrastructure! 
5. Data Visualizations: These are the best cities to live in car-free
6. Call to Action: Consider moving to one of these cities! Let’s all thrive car-free!

## The Data
#### 1. [Urban Mobility Readiness Index](https://www.oliverwymanforum.com/mobility/urban-mobility-readiness-index/ranking.html)
This dataset ranks public transportation systems in various cities based off of the Urban Mobility Readiness Index (UMR index) which they developed by taking into account the readiness of cities for future mobility trends across social impact, infrastructure, market attractiveness, system efficiency and innovation. Additionally they rank these cities by public transit, and sustainable mobility (2023, Olivia Wyman Forum). I plan on using this dataset as a way to identify cities that rank well across the board. Because in my visualizations, I will not be able to fit every single city in the world, this is how I will narrow down the top cities to include. 

#### 2. [Walkability Index](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/walkability-index1)
This dataset is from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that scores cities’ walkability based off of the EPA's previous data product, the Smart Location Database (SLD). I plan on using this dataset as another factor to take into consideration when assessing its car-less friendliness. Because this dataset is from the government and based off of census data, I believe it will be a good reality check to confirm whether the patterns align with other sources of data (2021, Data.gov)

#### 3. [Auto Sales](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/auto-sales)
The dataset, sourced from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, encompasses information on all passenger cars acquired between November 12, 2020, and January 24, 2023 (2023, data.org). My intention is to leverage this dataset to identify regions where practical car usage is currently at a minimum. It's important to note that the findings may diverge from assessments in two preceding datasets, as those datasets amalgamate various factors to derive metrics, introducing potential disparities in the evaluation of these locations.


## Method and medium
I plan to use Shorthand to complete my final project. I will be using a few stand out statistics and data visualizations in order to map out my story.
