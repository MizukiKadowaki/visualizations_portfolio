# Final Project - Part 3
Driving Change: Gen Z is Steering Away from American Car Reliance [Full Story](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/changing_car_dependency/index.html) |  [In-class Showcase Version](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/changing_car_dependency/gen-z-is-steering-away-from-car-reliance/index.html)

## Changes made since Part II
My story is centered around Gen Z and why society is shifting towards less car dependency. I started by investigating my own preference to not have my own car and explored the overall trend as to the reason behind that. 

I focused on visualizing American car dependency as compared to other countries and made many connections to Europe. Western Europe is very well known as being car obsessed and has a lot of infastructure built around cars, similar to the US. I wanted to bring in parallels of what Western Europe has done that is different form the US. 

In my visualizations, I wanted to focus on creating impact over focusing on precision. Because driving is such an everyday topic and pollution on such a large scale can be very difficult to visualize, I wanted to focus on ways to humanize these numbers to my audience can feel the gravity or driving. 

## The audience
My main audience is Gen Z and young millenials living in American cities. This is the group that has the strongest sentiment of not wanting to rely on a car. I've included alternative options for driving that have grown in popularity over the past few years and I believe that this is the demographic that will drive change in the future to make American cities less car dependent.

## Final design decisions
I chose to focus on using a color known as GenZ purple, which is the successor of millenial pink. This color is a signature part of [Olivia Rodrigo](https://store.oliviarodrigo.com/)'s album covers and music videos, and has been heavily used in marketing campaigns and packaging of brands targeting GenZ audiences includeing [Florence by Mills](https://florencebymills.com/), [Billie](https://mybillie.com/pages/razor?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaignid=20494107061&utm_adgroupid=161305278868&gclid=CjwKCAiAmsurBhBvEiwA6e-WPNVFlD3luBwKNgiZrfcseo0aIuPsopFY0Hi45Xpd6NO2_AQnsXtiThoCoaUQAvD_BwE) and [Studs](https://studs.com/).

## Final thoughts
Being in this class was a pleasure and I learned so much through the iterations of this project between each part. I've learned that it is much more important to be impactful in visualizations than precise and detailed. This is something that I want to continue to work on.
