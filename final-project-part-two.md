# Wireframes / storyboards
I changed my storyline from my part 1. 

Storyline: The purpose of this project is to raise awareness on Americans’ addiction to cars. 
1. Americans are addicted to cars 
2. But at what cost? 
  - So many car accident deaths every year
  - So many traffic related air pollution deaths every year
3. It's not a love affair. It's a Forced Addiction (History)
  - 1869-1920: The Golden Age of Railway Transportation
  - From 1922: GM/Ford started creating a car-centric society 
  - They created a viscious ending cycle of car dependency
4. But recognizing that car-centered transportation is a problem worth solving isn’t always easy.
  - pro-car bias: motonormativity
  - Studies have found that people who live in car-centric society more willing to overlook problems from cars than from other sources
5. Call to Action: First step to breaking addiction is to be aware that there is a problem 
  - Learn more about Americans' addiction to cars.


My current shortframe storyboard is [here](https://preview.shorthand.com/f1JsROPJZygw70wd). I have not yet added my redesigned visualizations and have images of similar visualizations in place. I will be adding references/citations and adjusting the style and adding relavent photos. 

# User research 

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Do you have any questions? | Clarify misconceptions straight away.|
| What is it about? What is your takeaway? | Make sure that the storyline served its intended purpose. |
| Did this affect you in any way? | Test the call to action.  |
| Which parts were most impactful? | Understand what worked.  |
| Did anything confuse you? | Understand what didn't work.  |


## Interview findings
From the feedback, I will make some changes for my final submission
- I will write out acronyms. I was trying to be mindful of including acronyms but I still missed a few and it made it difficult to understand. 
- I will make the style cohesive with black backgrounds and white words. I will occasionally use red accents. 
- I will slow down the movements of the photos because the scrolling made it 
- For the visualization explaining amatonormativity, I will try to have it on the side while the words scroll on the left side
