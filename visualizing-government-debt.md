### Part 3
I used a line chart in order to visualize changes in debt from each country over the years. I wanted to represent countries that saw a significant change in debt to GDP ratio, which is why I included countries that consistently stayed above or below 100. In order to establish 100 as a threshold, I made a bolded reference line. I found a significant pattern where the debt to GDP ratio in many countries started to rise dramatically in 2007 and start to taper or slowly decrease around 2014. Ireland had a unique pattern because although their debt increased dramatically, they also had the largest recovery out of all of the countries. I used a thicker line to highlight Ireland and used a different color to highlight it. I used green because It is a representative color of Ireland.
